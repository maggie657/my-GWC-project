      <h3>Bio:</h3>
          I am a girl who codes from Galt, CA. This school year I will be returning to
        Liberty Ranch High School as a senior who is extremely ready to graduate already.
        My home is technically past the city line so I am out in the sticks with my
        mom, dad, brother, our dog, and my 7 chickens. Usually, you will find me either out
        with friends, competing or practicing with one of our local swim teams, painting,
        cleaning and organizing the house, or exploring.

      </div>
      <p>
        Last week I built a Shakespearean Insult generator with my extra time in class.
        To build it I imported the random function and used to it to randomly select
        strings from 3 different lists and then combined the strings into an insulting sentence.
